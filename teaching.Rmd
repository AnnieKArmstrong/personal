********************
I have experience teaching in informal and formal settings, both in-person and online, and in working with audiences from pre-K to adults. I value the *co-production of knowledge* among instructors and students, and so I employ an *active learning pedagogy* that facilitates interaction while respecting the different ways in which students feel comfortable participating. I take a *whole-student* approach to teaching and work with students and support staff to ensure that student mental and physical well-being are addressed in and out of the classroom.
