### Anne K. Armstrong

Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in the [Civic Ecology Lab](www.civicecology.org) at Cornell University and am a mixed methods social scientist committed to transparent, community engaged scholarship. My dissertation investigates the development and longevity of place-based group identity in youth and alumni of the Bronx-based organization Rocking the Boat.
