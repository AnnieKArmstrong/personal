# Anne K. Armstrong

I am a PhD Candidate in the Civic Ecology Lab (Department of Natural Resources) at Cornell University. My dissertation investigates the development and longevity of place-based group identity in youth and alumni of Bronx-based organization Rocking the Boat. She is the lead author of *Climate Change Communication: A Guide for Educators* (2018, Cornell University Press). I am committed to community engaged research and to knowledge co-creation with community partners.
