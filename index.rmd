# Anne K. Armstrong

I am a PhD Candidate in the [Civic Ecology Lab](www.civicecology.org) at Cornell University. My dissertation investigates the development and longevity of place-based group identity in youth and alumni of the Bronx-based organization Rocking the Boat. I am also the lead author of [*Climate Change Communication: A Guide for Educators*](https://www.amazon.com/Communicating-Climate-Change-Educators-Environmental-ebook/dp/B07FT3V2G5/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&keywords=Anne+Armstrong&qid=1615581213&sr=8-4).
